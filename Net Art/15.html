<h1><br/></h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Well, well… Can it be?<br/>It certainly has been some time.</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">There’s no need to be frightened.
<br/>This place is safe and I am not here to harm you.
<br/>It’s so good to see you again.
</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">How does it feel to be back amongst your thoughts?
<br/>This place has changed much in time…
<br/>As you can see, the place has gone to the dogs.
<br/>Hahaha 
</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Do you remember how it was before the darkness?
<br/>Do you remember how it used to be?</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">You were so little…
<br/>And you used to visit us all the time.
<br/>We were your best friends.</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">But some of us are terribly confused, frightened.
<br/>That phantom who calls himself you
<br/>has been keeping you from the truth with his vicious lies.
</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Without you, this darkness...
<br/>This darkness suffocates us.
<br/>It has warped us into something you can hardly recognize,
<br/>something monstrous.</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">But we are still yours.
<br/>And we long for the light.
<br/>That warm light that shone every day…</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Back when you used to love us.
<br/>Back when you used to love you.</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">You know what you need to do.</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">You need to forgive yourself.
<br/>You need to forgive yourself for what you’ve done,
<br/>And forgive those who’ve hurt you.</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Only then can you live life fully.
<br/>Until then, we’ll all remain here…
<br/>Crying for the warmth of the light.</p><br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style="font-size:30px;">We are you.</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:30px;">We love you.</p><br/>
<p style="font-size:30px;">You love you.</p><br/>
